== Welcome to the `pot` documentation

Welcome! This is the documentation of `pot`, an open source jail framework/manager for FreeBSD.
It's designed to support multiple jail usage, from VM emulation to small container model.

A good place to start, is the xref:Getting.adoc[Getting started guide] or the xref:Installation.adoc[Installation Guide]. +
`pot` can be used to manage xref:Thin.adoc[Thin jails], xref:Thick.adoc[Thick jails] or xref:Container.adoc[Containers]. +
There are also detailed sections about xref:Network.adoc[Network configuration of a `pot`] and xref:Images.adoc[Pot images].

A FAQ section is in development and available xref:FAQ.adoc[here]
Soon, you'll find additional sections about `potMachine`, to allow you to use `pot` on different operating systems, and `minipot`, a one-node based service mesh that allow you to play with `nomad`
